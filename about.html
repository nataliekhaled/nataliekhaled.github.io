    <p id="About Natalie Khaled">
        Hello there. I am from Tulsa, Oklahoma and I have an identical twin. I have been going to OU for about 5 years now... Oops. I am working on my undergraduate in Accounting and Management Information Systems. I am also getting my Masters in IT. I hope to work for a company that will care about me. The most important thing to me is making sure I enjoy going to work ~~~~ yanooo!
